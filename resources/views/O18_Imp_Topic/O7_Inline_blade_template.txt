Inline Blade templates in Laravel allow you to define reusable UI components directly within your Blade files, without creating separate class-based components.
Here’s a breakdown of how they work and when to use them:

🧩 What Are Inline Blade Templates?
Inline Blade templates—also known as inline components—are a way to define small, reusable chunks of HTML and Blade logic directly inside your Blade views. They’re ideal for simple UI elements like buttons, alerts, or cards that don’t require a full component class.

⚙️ How to Use Inline Components
You define an inline component using the @component directive and close it with @endcomponent. Here’s a basic example:
@component('components.alert')
    <strong>Heads up!</strong> This is an alert.
@endcomponent


But with inline components, you can skip the separate file and define it directly:
@props(['type' => 'info'])

<div class="alert alert-{{ $type }}">
    {{ $slot }}
</div>


This can be placed in resources/views/components/alert.blade.php and used like:
<x-alert type="warning">
    <strong>Warning!</strong> Something went wrong.
</x-alert>



🧠 Key Features
- No need for a class: Inline components are purely Blade-based.
- Props support: Use @props to define expected attributes.
- Slots: The {{ $slot }} variable allows you to inject content.
- Anonymous components: You can use them without registering in App\View\Components.

🛠️ When to Use Inline Components
- For simple UI elements that don’t need logic-heavy behavior.
- When you want quick reuse without creating a PHP class.
- To keep your Blade views clean and modular.

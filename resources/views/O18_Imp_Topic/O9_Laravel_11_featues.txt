Laravel 11 introduces a slimmed-down structure, simplified configuration, and new artisan command enhancements—making it faster and cleaner for modern development.

🚀 Key Features in Laravel 11
Here are the most notable updates:
- Slim Skeleton: Laravel 11 removes several default folders like app/Console, app/Exceptions, and app/Http/Middleware. Routes, middleware, and exception handling are now registered in bootstrap/app.php.
- Minimal Service Providers: Only AppServiceProvider.php is included by default. You can add others manually if needed.
- Simplified Routing: Routes are now defined directly in bootstrap/app.php, reducing boilerplate for small apps.
- No Middleware Folder: Middleware is registered inline or via closures, streamlining the setup.
- Improved Performance: Laravel 11 includes internal optimizations for faster boot times and reduced memory usage.
- Updated Versioning Policy: Laravel continues its yearly major release cycle, with Laravel 11 released on March 12, 2024.

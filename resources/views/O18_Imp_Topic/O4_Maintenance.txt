Laravel maintenance involves keeping your application secure, performant, and up-to-date through regular updates,
code hygiene, and automation


⚙️ Framework & Dependency Updates
- Always use the latest stable Laravel version.
- Run composer update regularly to keep packages fresh.
- Use composer outdated to audit stale dependencies.

🧼 Codebase Hygiene
- Stick to Laravel’s default folder structure for consistency.
- Use PSR-12 coding standards and run tools like php-cs-fixer.
- Remove unused classes, traits, and service providers.

🧪 Testing & Debugging
- Write unit tests using PHPUnit or Pest.
- Use feature tests to simulate user interactions.
- Prevent N+1 queries with Eloquent’s with() eager loading.
- Enable strict mode in Eloquent (Model::preventLazyLoading()).

🔐 Security Practices
- Use Laravel’s built-in CSRF protection.
- Validate all inputs using Form Requests.
- Sanitize user data before storage or display.
- Keep .env secrets out of version control.

📦 Database Maintenance
- Use anonymous migrations (return new class extends Migration) to avoid class name collisions.
- Always define both up() and down() methods in migrations.
- Run php artisan migrate:status to audit migration health.

🧹 Cleanup & Optimization
- Schedule php artisan optimize:clear weekly.
- Prune old logs with php artisan log:clear or custom scheduler.
- Use php artisan config:cache and route:cache for performance.
- Dispatch long-running jobs with dispatchAfterResponse().

📊 Monitoring & Reporting
- Use Laravel Telescope or Ray for debugging and insights.
- Monitor queue failures with php artisan queue:failed.
- Log slow queries and exceptions using Monolog or Sentry.

📅 Scheduled Tasks
- Use App\Console\Kernel to define cron jobs.
- Run php artisan schedule:run via system cron every minute.
- Automate backups, cleanup, and email reports.

🧰 DevOps & Deploymen
- Use .env for environment-specific configs.
- Automate deployment with tools like Envoyer, Deployer, or GitHub Actions.
- Run php artisan down before deploying and php artisan up after.

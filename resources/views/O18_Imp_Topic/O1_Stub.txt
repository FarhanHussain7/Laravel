🧩 What Are Laravel Stubs?
- Stubs are template files used by Artisan commands to generate code.
- They contain placeholders like {{ class }} or {{ namespace }}.
- Laravel replaces these placeholders when you run commands like make:model.


📁 How to Publish Stubs
- Run this command:
php artisan stub:publish
- Laravel copies its internal stubs to your project’s /stubs folder.
- You can now edit these files to customize generated code.

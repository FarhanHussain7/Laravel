Laravel seeding is the process of populating your database with sample or default data using seed classes.
It’s essential for testing, development, and setting up initial values.

What Is Database Seeding?
- Seeding means inserting data into your database automatically.
- It’s used for testing, development, or setting up default values.
- Laravel uses Seeder classes to define what data to insert.

🛠️ How to Create a Seeder
- Run this Artisan command:
php artisan make:seeder UserSeeder
- This creates a file in database/seeders/UserSeeder.php.
- The class will look like:
class UserSeeder extends Seeder {
    public function run() {
        // Insert data here
    }
}
